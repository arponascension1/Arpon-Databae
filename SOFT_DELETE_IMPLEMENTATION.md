# Soft Delete Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive soft delete functionality for the Eloquent ORM wrapper, providing full Laravel-compatible soft delete features.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Core Soft Delete Components

#### SoftDeletes Trait (`src/Database/Eloquent/Concerns/SoftDeletes.php`)
- **bootSoftDeletes()**: Automatically registers the SoftDeleteScope global scope
- **initializeSoftDeletes()**: Sets up date casting for deleted_at column
- **performDeleteOnModel()**: Implements soft delete logic (sets deleted_at timestamp)
- **restore()**: Restores soft deleted models (sets deleted_at to null)
- **forceDelete()**: Performs permanent deletion bypassing soft delete
- **trashed()**: Checks if a model is soft deleted
- **getDeletedAtColumn()**: Returns the soft delete column name
- **getQualifiedDeletedAtColumn()**: Returns fully qualified deleted_at column name

#### SoftDeleteScope (`src/Database/Eloquent/Scopes/SoftDeleteScope.php`)
- **apply()**: Automatically excludes soft deleted records from queries
- **extend()**: Adds query builder macros for soft delete functionality
- **withTrashed()**: Include soft deleted records in queries
- **withoutTrashed()**: Explicitly exclude soft deleted records
- **onlyTrashed()**: Query only soft deleted records
- **restore()**: Restore soft deleted models via query builder

### 2. Model System Enhancements

#### Enhanced Model Class (`src/Database/Eloquent/Model.php`)
- **Trait Boot System**: Automatically calls boot{TraitName} methods for all traits
- **Trait Initialization**: Calls initialize{TraitName} methods during model construction
- **Global Scope Management**: Register and manage global scopes
- **Model Event System**: Fire and listen for model events (deleting, deleted, restoring, restored)

#### Query Builder Extensions (`src/Database/Eloquent/EloquentBuilder.php`)
- **Macro System**: Register and call custom query builder methods
- **OnDelete Callback**: Support for custom delete behavior
- **Scope Integration**: Seamless integration with global and local scopes

### 3. Supporting Infrastructure

#### Helper Functions
- **class_uses_recursive()**: Recursively get all traits used by a class
- **trait_uses_recursive()**: Recursively get traits used by a trait
- **class_basename()**: Get class name without namespace
- **array_wrap()**: Convert values to arrays
- **data_get()**: Get nested array/object values with dot notation
- **value()**: Resolve closure values

## Usage Examples

### Basic Soft Delete Model
```php
use Arpon\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Arpon\Database\Eloquent\Concerns\SoftDeletes;

class User extends Model 
{
    use SoftDeletes;

    protected array $dates = ['deleted_at'];
}
```

### Database Migration
```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN deleted_at TIMESTAMP NULL DEFAULT NULL;
```

### Using Soft Deletes
```php
// Soft delete a model
$user = User::find(1);
$user->delete(); // Sets deleted_at timestamp

// Check if model is trashed
if ($user->trashed()) {
    echo "User is soft deleted";
}

// Restore a soft deleted model
$user->restore(); // Sets deleted_at to null

// Force delete (permanent)
$user->forceDelete(); // Actually removes from database

// Query with trashed models
$allUsers = User::withTrashed()->get();
$trashedUsers = User::onlyTrashed()->get();
$activeUsers = User::all(); // Excludes trashed automatically

// Restore via query
User::onlyTrashed()->where('email', 'test@example.com')->restore();
```

## Test Results

The comprehensive test suite (`test_soft_deletes.php`) validates:

✅ **Model Creation**: Create models with soft delete capability
✅ **Soft Delete**: Delete models while preserving data
✅ **Trashed Detection**: Check if models are soft deleted
✅ **Query Scoping**: Automatic exclusion of deleted records
✅ **Restore Functionality**: Restore soft deleted models
✅ **Force Delete**: Permanent deletion
✅ **Scope Extensions**: withTrashed(), onlyTrashed(), withoutTrashed()
✅ **Bulk Operations**: Bulk delete and restore
✅ **Model Events**: Event firing for restoring/restored events

## Key Technical Achievements

### 1. Laravel Compatibility
- Full API compatibility with Laravel's soft delete system
- Same method names, signatures, and behavior
- Drop-in replacement for Laravel Eloquent soft deletes

### 2. Advanced Query Scoping
- Automatic global scope registration via trait boot system
- Query builder macro registration for dynamic method injection
- Proper scope isolation and removal mechanisms

### 3. Robust Event System
- Model event registration and firing
- Support for model lifecycle events
- Event-driven architecture for extensibility

### 4. Trait Boot System
- Automatic trait discovery and boot method calling
- Trait initialization support
- Proper inheritance and trait composition handling

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `src/Database/Eloquent/Concerns/SoftDeletes.php`
- `src/Database/Eloquent/Scopes/SoftDeleteScope.php`
- `test_soft_deletes.php`

### Enhanced Files
- `src/Database/Eloquent/Model.php` - Added boot system and event support
- `src/Database/Eloquent/EloquentBuilder.php` - Added macro system
- `src/Database/Eloquent/Scopes/Scope.php` - Base scope interface

## Integration Notes

The soft delete system integrates seamlessly with the existing Enhanced Scopes System, providing a complete, production-ready solution for soft delete functionality in the Eloquent ORM wrapper.

All features follow Laravel conventions and provide full backward compatibility while extending the ORM capabilities significantly.
